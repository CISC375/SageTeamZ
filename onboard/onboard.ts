		/*
			----- ADDED COMPONENTS TO USERS ----
			commandUsage is an array that will be utilized as a dictionary of sorts which will count each use of specific commands that the user can use and input them into a count which can be
			which can be used for activity metrics. (OBJECT IE {COMMAND NAME: ----, COUNT: ---},{...........})

			responseTime is a double and will be set as the delta or time difference between the last message and the current,
			this is helpful for tracking activity based on how fast they respond or send messages between their channel activity and keeps a form of record.
			lastMessage is a timestamp that will be utilized in the responseTime calculation such as given the timestamp of last and current the difference
			will be used to set the value of responseTime

			timestampArray is an array of array that will be set between time periods etc 12:00-12:59, 1:00-1:59,.... and the other axis of the multidimensional array
		will be M, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN then at the cross section will be a count of the users message to track peak hours and of which days

			activityLevel: activityLevel describes whether the user is active, mildly inactive, moderately inactive, or highly
			inactive which also takes into account whether or not the user is new. inactivity level will be incremented
			if the command count for that week is 0.

			isNewUser: describes whether the user is new, will set the user as new (true) when user is onboarded.

			messageCount: field to track the number of messages the user has sent for that week. if the number of messages
			is less than threshold for that week, then the activity level will be moved up and the messageCount will be
			wiped weekly.

			will be M, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI, SAT, SUN then at the cross section will be a count of the users message to track peak hours and of which days
			(APPEND ARRAY FOR EACH DAY)(Should be one big array as the holder array [] 2nd level [[]] down will be the DAYS 3rd level [[[]]] will be HOURS)

			TIMESTAMPARRAY (WILL BE TWO EMPTY ARRAY BUT WHEN MESSAGE ADD INFORMATION)

			activityLog will be an array of objects that will be utilized to track activity from users such as date, time, what used, etc from discord
			feedbackLog will be an array of objects to track question and their response (WILL BE EMPTY ARRAY BUT PUSH AN OBJECT)

			personalizeRec will be an object that will be used by a modal to then allow users to alter and change how they recieve messages and recommendations
			this is where we will determine how the user will recieve specific messages and descriptions will go into the object
			such as:
			- type user (active, inactive)
			- most used command type
			- recommendation type (default server announcements ephemeral)(announcements, last channel, DM, no suggestions, etc)
			- aggressive or not (timer could be different for everyone or whatnot)
			- tone of messages (casual, formal)
			- current frequency
